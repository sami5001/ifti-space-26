  This paper presents experimental and computational investigation of transpiration cooling using porous Ultra-High-Temperature-Ceramics (UHTC) at hypersonic conditions. Results demonstrate that transpiration cooling can increase the potential temperature threshold of porous walls up to 3500 K, representing a significant advancement in thermal protection system capabilities for hypersonic vehicles.
