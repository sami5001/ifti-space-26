  This DPhil research investigates transpiration cooling systems for hypersonic vehicles using porous Ultra-High-Temperature-Ceramics (UHTC). The work has successfully increased the potential temperature threshold of porous wall cooling systems up to 3500 K.

  The research focuses on understanding coolant gas aerodynamic interactions within hypersonic boundary layers, developing novel methodologies for thermal protection systems that can withstand extreme conditions during hypersonic flight.

## Project Overview

Hypersonic vehicles experience extreme thermal loads during flight, with leading edge temperatures potentially exceeding 2000 K. Traditional thermal protection systems are insufficient for sustained hypersonic flight, necessitating active cooling solutions.

This research develops transpiration cooling techniques using porous Ultra-High-Temperature-Ceramics (UHTC). By forcing coolant gas through the porous surface, we create a protective film that significantly reduces heat transfer to the vehicle structure.

### Research Objectives

1. Characterize heat transfer through porous UHTC materials under hypersonic conditions
2. Develop computational models for coolant-boundary layer interaction
3. Optimize coolant injection strategies for maximum thermal protection efficiency
4. Validate numerical predictions against experimental data

### Key Achievement

The research has demonstrated that transpiration cooling can increase the potential temperature threshold of porous walls up to 3500 K, a significant advancement presented at AIAA SPACE 2018.

### Methodology

The project combines:
- High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations
- Experimental validation in hypersonic wind tunnels
- Material characterization of porous UHTC substrates
- Development of analytical models for design optimization
