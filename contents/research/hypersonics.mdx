## Project Overview

Hypersonic flight represents one of the most challenging regimes in aerospace engineering. At speeds exceeding Mach 5, air cannot move out of the way fast enough, creating intense shock waves and extreme heating that fundamentally change how vehicles must be designed.

### Research Focus Areas

1. **High-Speed Aerothermodynamics**
   - Understanding heat transfer mechanisms at hypersonic speeds
   - Modeling temperature distributions on vehicle surfaces
   - Developing thermal protection strategies

2. **Flow Physics**
   - Boundary layer behavior in hypersonic flow
   - Shock-boundary layer interactions
   - Real gas effects at high temperatures

3. **Computational Methods**
   - High-fidelity CFD simulations
   - Validation against experimental data
   - Development of reduced-order models

### Applications

This fundamental research supports the development of:
- Reusable space launch vehicles
- Hypersonic transport aircraft
- Atmospheric entry systems
- High-speed missiles and defense systems

### Facilities

Research is conducted using the world-class facilities at the Oxford Thermofluids Institute, including hypersonic wind tunnels and advanced computational resources.
