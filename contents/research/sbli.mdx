## Project Overview

Shock/Boundary-Layer Interaction (SBLI) is a fundamental phenomenon in high-speed aerodynamics where oblique shock waves interact with the boundary layer on a vehicle surface. These interactions can cause flow separation, increased heating, and unsteady loading.

### Research Objectives

This research investigates how coolant gas aerodynamic interactions within hypersonic boundary layers affect SBLI characteristics. The goals include:

1. **Understanding Interaction Physics**
   - How coolant injection modifies the boundary layer structure
   - Effect on shock wave strength and position
   - Impact on separation bubble dynamics

2. **Heat Transfer Characterization**
   - Local heating augmentation due to SBLI
   - Cooling effectiveness in interaction regions
   - Thermal gradients and material stress

3. **Flow Control Strategies**
   - Optimizing coolant injection to mitigate adverse SBLI effects
   - Active control techniques for unsteady interactions
   - Design guidelines for thermal protection systems

### Methodology

The research combines:
- Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
- Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) modeling
- Experimental validation in hypersonic facilities
- Theoretical analysis of interaction scaling laws

### Significance

Understanding SBLI is essential for:
- Designing control surfaces that operate reliably at hypersonic speeds
- Predicting heating loads for thermal protection system sizing
- Developing active cooling systems that perform well during flow interactions
