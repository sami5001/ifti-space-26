Welcome to your new academic portfolio website! This post will help you get started with customizing and adding content.

## Quick Start

Your portfolio is organized around several content types:

1. **Profile** - Your personal information and bio
2. **Research** - Research projects and their details
3. **Publications** - Journal articles, preprints, and other publications
4. **Talks** - Conference presentations and workshops
5. **Posters** - Conference poster presentations
6. **Blog** - Your thoughts and articles

## Adding Content

All content is written in MDX format, which combines Markdown with React components. Here's what you need to know:

### Frontmatter

Each file starts with frontmatter (metadata) between `---` markers:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Title"
publishedAt: "2024-01-15"
---
```

### Markdown Content

After the frontmatter, write your content using standard Markdown:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Lists and headings
- Code blocks

## Customization

Edit the files in `/config/site.ts` to customize:

- Site name and description
- Navigation links
- Social media links
- Footer content

## Deployment

Your site is ready to deploy on Vercel:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

Happy writing!
