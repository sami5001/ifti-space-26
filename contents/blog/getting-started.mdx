Welcome to my academic research blog! This is where I share insights from my research in hypersonic vehicle technology and aerospace engineering at the University of Oxford.

## About This Blog

Here you'll find:

1. **Research Updates** - Progress on transpiration cooling and thermal protection systems
2. **Technical Insights** - Deep dives into hypersonic flow phenomena
3. **Conference Notes** - Reflections from AIAA conferences and other events
4. **Academic Life** - Experiences as a DPhil candidate at Oxford

## Research Focus

My current research at the Oxford Thermofluids Institute focuses on transpiration cooling of hypersonic vehicles. This involves:

- Investigating porous Ultra-High-Temperature-Ceramics (UHTC)
- Understanding coolant gas interactions with hypersonic boundary layers
- Developing thermal protection systems for next-generation aerospace vehicles

## Recent Achievements

Our team has demonstrated that transpiration cooling can increase the potential temperature threshold of porous wall systems up to 3500 K - a significant advancement presented at AIAA SPACE 2018.
