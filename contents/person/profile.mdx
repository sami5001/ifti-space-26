bio: |
  I am a DPhil candidate at the University of Oxford, specializing in hypersonic vehicle cooling systems. My research focuses on transpiration cooling using porous Ultra-High-Temperature-Ceramics (UHTC), investigating coolant gas aerodynamic interactions within hypersonic boundary layers.

  The determination of achieving deep knowledge in the field of Aeronautics & Astronautics isn't merely to live a dream but also to dedicate my work to ensure the pleasure, welfare and safety of humankind.

## About Me

I am a doctoral researcher at the Oxford Thermofluids Institute, part of the Oxford Hypersonics Group. My work has increased the potential temperature threshold of porous wall cooling systems up to 3500 K, which was presented at AIAA SPACE in 2018.

Before joining Oxford, I completed my bachelor's degree (2014) and master's degree (2016) in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Stuttgart, Germany. During my master's studies, I was a Visiting Research Scholar at the University of Arizona in 2015, supported by the prestigious Erich-Becker Scholarship.

I gained industrial experience through an internship at Airbus Group's A380 Chief Engineering Department in Hamburg, where my bachelor's thesis work was subsequently implemented on the final assembly line.
