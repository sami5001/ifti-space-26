## Background

Hassan Saad Ifti is a DPhil candidate at the University of Oxford, working within the Oxford Thermofluids Institute and Oxford Hypersonics Group. His research focuses on developing advanced thermal protection systems for hypersonic vehicles through transpiration cooling technology.

The determination of achieving deep knowledge in the field of Aeronautics & Astronautics isn't merely to live a dream but also to dedicate his work to ensure the pleasure, welfare and safety of humankind.

## Education

### University of Oxford (2016 - Present)
**PhD in Engineering Science**

Currently pursuing a doctorate focusing on "Transpiration Cooling of a Hypersonic Vehicle." The research investigates cooling systems using porous Ultra-High-Temperature-Ceramics (UHTC), with results demonstrating temperature thresholds up to 3500 K.

### University of Stuttgart (2014 - 2016)
**MSc in Aerospace Engineering**

Completed a Master of Science with specializations in mathematical and physical modeling, jet propulsion, and high-speed aerodynamics. During this time, served as a Visiting Research Scholar at the University of Arizona (2015-2016), supported by the prestigious Erich-Becker Scholarship.

### University of Stuttgart (2010 - 2014)
**BSc in Aerospace Engineering**

Bachelor's thesis completed at Airbus Deutschland GmbH in the A380 Chief Engineering Department, Hamburg. The research results were subsequently implemented on the A380 final assembly line.

## Research Experience

### Oxford Thermofluids Institute (2016 - Present)
**Doctoral Scholar**

Conducting research on transpiration cooling of hypersonic vehicles, with key achievements including increasing the potential temperature threshold of porous wall cooling systems up to 3500 K.

### University of Arizona, CFD Laboratory (2015 - 2016)
**Visiting Research Scholar**

Collaborative research on computational fluid dynamics for high-speed flows, supported by the Erich-Becker Scholarship.

### Airbus A380 Chief Engineering (2013 - 2014)
**Research Student**

Completed bachelor's thesis within the A380 program, with results implemented on the final assembly line in Hamburg.
