## Research Experience

### Oxford Thermofluids Institute (2016 - Present)
**Doctoral Scholar**

Conducting cutting-edge research on transpiration cooling of hypersonic vehicles using porous Ultra-High-Temperature-Ceramics (UHTC). Key achievement: Demonstrated temperature threshold capability up to 3500 K.

Research areas include:
- Hypersonic vehicle thermal protection
- Transpiration cooling systems
- Shock/Boundary-Layer Interaction (SBLI)
- High-speed aerothermodynamics

### University of Arizona, CFD Laboratory (2015 - 2016)
**Visiting Research Scholar**

Supported by the Erich-Becker Scholarship. Conducted research on computational fluid dynamics for high-speed flows in collaboration with the CFD Laboratory team.

### Airbus A380 Chief Engineering (2013 - 2014)
**Research Student**

Completed bachelor's thesis within the A380 program. Research results were subsequently implemented on the A380 final assembly line.
