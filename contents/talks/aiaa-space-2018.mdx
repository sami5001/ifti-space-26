## Talk Abstract

Presentation of research findings on transpiration cooling using porous Ultra-High-Temperature-Ceramics (UHTC) at hypersonic conditions. The talk demonstrated how transpiration cooling can increase the potential temperature threshold of porous walls up to 3500 K.

## Key Points

1. Introduction to hypersonic thermal protection challenges
2. Overview of transpiration cooling concept
3. Experimental and computational methodology
4. Results showing 3500 K temperature threshold achievement
5. Implications for future hypersonic vehicle design
